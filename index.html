        My name is Stephanie Aurelio and I am a student in the Fall 2019 UCLA Extension Coding Bootcamp. Before taking the leap to learn how to code, I was a museum fundraiser, a luxury yoga-pants-seller, a face painter at children's birthday parties, and, most recently, a librarian. My diverse history of jobs has taught me to be flexible, creative, and adaptable. My years of librarianship have given me extensive skills in finding out the answer to any question, no matter how strange, which I think lends itself well to development. I posess a Bachelor of Arts in History from California State University, Sacramento, and a Master's in Library and Information Science from San Jose State University.

        Besides my collection of jobs and degrees, I am an avid reader, a major coffee drinker, a podcast addict, and am most at home hanging upside down in the air at an aerial class. I'm an Aquarius Sun Gemini Moon Cancer Rising and if you don't know what that means, don't worry I will probably tell you all about it. I also just adopted a Shih Tzu named Shadow, and he is the best buddy to have on your lap while trying to code.
